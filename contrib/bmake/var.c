 * Handling of variables and the expressions formed from them.
 *
 * Variables are set using lines of the form VAR=value.  Both the variable
 * name and the value can contain references to other variables, by using
 * expressions like ${VAR}, ${VAR:Modifiers}, ${${VARNAME}} or ${VAR:${MODS}}.
 *
 * Interface:
 *	Var_Init	Initialize this module.
 *
 *	Var_End		Clean up the module.
 *
 *	Var_Set
 *	Var_SetExpand
 *			Set the value of the variable, creating it if
 *			necessary.
 *
 *	Var_Append
 *	Var_AppendExpand
 *			Append more characters to the variable, creating it if
 *			necessary. A space is placed between the old value and
 *			the new one.
 *
 *	Var_Exists
 *	Var_ExistsExpand
 *			See if a variable exists.
 *
 *	Var_Value	Return the unexpanded value of a variable, or NULL if
 *			the variable is undefined.
 *
 *	Var_Subst	Substitute all variable expressions in a string.
 *
 *	Var_Parse	Parse a variable expression such as ${VAR:Mpattern}.
 *
 *	Var_Delete
 *			Delete a variable.
 *
 *	Var_ReexportVars
 *			Export some or even all variables to the environment
 *			of this process and its child processes.
 *
 *	Var_Export	Export the variable to the environment of this process
 *			and its child processes.
 *
 *	Var_UnExport	Don't export the variable anymore.
 *
 * Debugging:
 *	Var_Stats	Print out hashing statistics if in -dh mode.
 *
 *	Var_Dump	Print out all variables defined in the given scope.
 *
 * XXX: There's a lot of almost duplicate code in these functions that only
 *  differs in subtle details that are not mentioned in the manual page.

 * not be possible to undefine a variable during the evaluation of an
 * expression, or Var.name might point nowhere.  (There is another,
 * unintended way to undefine a scope variable, see varmod-loop-delete.mk.)
 *
 * Environment variables are short-lived.  They are returned by VarFind, and
 * after using them, they must be freed using VarFreeShortLived.
 *
 * Undefined variables occur during evaluation of variable expressions such
 * as ${UNDEF:Ufallback} in Var_Parse and ApplyModifiers.

/*
 * The ApplyModifier functions take an expression that is being evaluated.
 * Their task is to apply a single modifier to the expression.  This involves
 * parsing the modifier, evaluating it and finally updating the value of the
 * expression.
 *
 * Parsing the modifier
 *
 * If parsing succeeds, the parsing position *pp is updated to point to the
 * first character following the modifier, which typically is either ':' or
 * ch->endc.  The modifier doesn't have to check for this delimiter character,
 * this is done by ApplyModifiers.
 *
 * XXX: As of 2020-11-15, some modifiers such as :S, :C, :P, :L do not
 * need to be followed by a ':' or endc; this was an unintended mistake.
 *
 * If parsing fails because of a missing delimiter (as in the :S, :C or :@
 * modifiers), return AMR_CLEANUP.
 *
 * If parsing fails because the modifier is unknown, return AMR_UNKNOWN to
 * try the SysV modifier ${VAR:from=to} as fallback.  This should only be
 * done as long as there have been no side effects from evaluating nested
 * variables, to avoid evaluating them more than once.  In this case, the
 * parsing position may or may not be updated.  (XXX: Why not? The original
 * parsing position is well-known in ApplyModifiers.)
 *
 * If parsing fails and the SysV modifier ${VAR:from=to} should not be used
 * as a fallback, either issue an error message using Error or Parse_Error
 * and then return AMR_CLEANUP, or return AMR_BAD for the default error
 * message.  Both of these return values will stop processing the variable
 * expression.  (XXX: As of 2020-08-23, evaluation of the whole string
 * continues nevertheless after skipping a few bytes, which essentially is
 * undefined behavior.  Not in the sense of C, but still the resulting string
 * is garbage.)
 *
 * Evaluating the modifier
 *
 * After parsing, the modifier is evaluated.  The side effects from evaluating
 * nested variable expressions in the modifier text often already happen
 * during parsing though.  For most modifiers this doesn't matter since their
 * only noticeable effect is that they update the value of the expression.
 * Some modifiers such as ':sh' or '::=' have noticeable side effects though.
 *
 * Evaluating the modifier usually takes the current value of the variable
 * expression from ch->expr->value, or the variable name from ch->var->name
 * and stores the result back in expr->value via Expr_SetValueOwn or
 * Expr_SetValueRefer.
 *
 * If evaluating fails (as of 2020-08-23), an error message is printed using
 * Error.  This function has no side-effects, it really just prints the error
 * message.  Processing the expression continues as if everything were ok.
 * XXX: This should be fixed by adding proper error handling to Var_Subst,
 * Var_Parse, ApplyModifiers and ModifyWords.
 *
 * Housekeeping
 *
 * Some modifiers such as :D and :U turn undefined expressions into defined
 * expressions (see Expr_Define).
 *
 * Some modifiers need to free some memory.
